# AI Chatbot Application with Spring Boot

This repository contains the AI Chatbot Application, a Spring Boot backend service that integrates OpenAI's Ollama Llama 3 model to power conversations with AI-generated profiles. The application allows a single user to match and have conversations with a few predefined AI-generated profiles, simulating a chat environment.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Single user setup.
- **AI-Generated Profiles**: Multiple pre-generated profiles by AI that users can interact with.
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time chat interface between the user and matched AI profiles.
- **Integration with Ollama Llama 3**: Utilizes OpenAI's Ollama Llama 3 for generating dynamic and context-aware responses.

## Usage

After launching the application, follow these steps to interact with AI-generated profiles:

1. **Log in as the Default User**: This application currently supports only one user.
2. **Choose a Profile to Chat With**: Select from available AI-generated profiles.
